        <h2>About Leonardo da Vinci</h2>
        <p>Italian polymath of the High Renaissance, Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci[b] (15 April 1452 â€“ 2 May 1519) worked as a painter, draftsman, engineer, scientist, theorist, sculptor, and architect.Although his accomplishments as a painter brought him initial notoriety, he also gained notoriety for the sketches and notes he created in his notebooks on a wide range of topics, such as anatomy, astronomy, botany, mapping, painting, and paleontology.Most people agree that Leonardo was a genius who personified the Renaissance humanist ideal. His body of work is considered to have contributed more to art history than any other artist, with the exception of Michelangelo Buonarroti, who was 23 years younger than Leonardo. </p>
        <p>Leonardo is widely acknowledged as the creator of the High Renaissance and as one of the finest artists in art history.Even with a large number of lost works and less than 25 major works attributable to him (many of which were left unfinished), he produced some of the most important paintings in Western art history.The Mona Lisa, his masterpiece, is widely recognized as the most renowned painting in the world.In addition to being the most copied religious painting ever made, Leonardo da Vinci's sketch of the Last Supper is also recognized as a cultural symbol. Salvator Mundi, a picture that is either entirely or partially credited to Leonardo,broke the record for the most expensive painting ever sold at a public auction in 2017 when it was sold for US$450.3 million. </p>
